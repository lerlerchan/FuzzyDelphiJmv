# Fuzzy Delphi Module for Jamovi
## Background
The fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) is a modified version of the classical Delphi technique that applies fuzzy set theory to handle the ambiguity and vagueness in expert opinions. Jamovi is an open source statistical software that is user-friendly and based on R programming language. The project investigates the evolution of a FDM module that has been incorporated into Jamovi and explores its potential uses and benefits.

## Project Aim
To develop a flexible fuzzy Delphi module for the Jamovi statistical analysis platform that allows users to customize and refine the Delphi technique according to their own research needs and preferences.

## Installation
Step-by-step images procedure can be view at
[Here](https://github.com/lerlerchan/FuzzyDelphiJmv/blob/main/tutorial/Installation_Procedure.pdf)

To install the Fuzzy Delphi module in [Jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/download.html), follow these steps:

1. Click on the “+” icon in the top-right corner of Jamovi to access the module installation options.
2. Choose the Jamovi library from the menu that opens. OR download from [Here](https://github.com/lerlerchan/FuzzyDelphiJmv/blob/main/FuzzyDelphiJmv_1.0.0.jmo)

3. In the window that appears, click on “Available” (located at the top-middle).
4. Browse through the list of modules and click “INSTALL” for the Fuzzy Delphi module or any other module you’d like to use.
5. Finally, close the window by clicking the arrow pointing up in the top-right corner.
Once installed, you’ll be able to utilize the Fuzzy Delphi module for your
research needs and customize it according to your preferences
